# Description

This is a web application that allows users to share secrets anonymously. Users must be authenticated to write a new secret, and are required to create an account. This application focuses heavily on the backend side by using hashing and salting to register/login users or allowing them to sign up with Google or Facebook.

# Technologies used

* Express;
* EJS;
* MongoDB/Mongoose;
* Passport.

# Live version

A live version of this app can be found [here](https://a-secrets-app.herokuapp.com/). However, sign up using social media is working only locally, and therefore to create a new account you should use the email and password option.
